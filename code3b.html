 	<P  class ="container" style=" color: white; font-size: 15px;">The largest hornbill species in India, Great Hornbills are also called Great Indian or Great Pied Hornbills. In India they are mainly found in the foothills of the Himalayas and parts of northeast India, along with the Western Ghats. These striking birds measure 95 to 130cm in length and are identified by their black and white plumage and their large, curved beaks. The upper mandibles are bright yellow in colour with a distinct casque on top. In males, the casque has black markings towards the tip. Females have smaller-sized casques devoid of the black markings. Great Hornbills are found in tropical and subtropical montane, deciduous and evergreen forests. The density of the forest region correlates with the hornbill population of the area. Great Hornbills nest within natural cavities of large, old trees, especially those that rise above the canopy. Apart from deforestation and habitat fragmentation, their populations are also significantly impacted by hunting. Myths about the medicinal value of their meat and an interest in their large casques makes them frequent targets.

 	<P  class ="container" style=" color: white; font-size: 15px;">Uncommon smooth gray pigeon with dark rusty-red wings. Black-and-white barred neck pattern only visible if seen well. Inhabits wet forests in hilly and montane areas, where it typically forages quietly up in the canopy; occasionally descends down to feed on the ground.The most striking feature of the beautiful Nilgiri wood-pigeon (Columba elphinstonii) is the black and white checkerboard pattern on the back of its neck. Unlike its sometimes unpopular urban cousin, the rock pigeon (Columba livia), which is a familiar inhabitant of cities and parks, the Nilgiri wood-pigeon is a rather more rare bird, endemic to the Western Ghats in India. Occasionally gives low sonorous coos.The Nilgiri wood-pigeon is one of only 16 bird species endemic to the Western Ghats of south-western India. Its range stretches from north-western Maharashtra, south through to Karnataka and Goa, to southern Kerala and western Tamil Nadu. The Nilgiri wood-pigeon is classified as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List.

 		 <center><img class="image-fluid" src="77f2012206e34b4bbe9ac90a8db8513a.jpg" height="40%" width="40%" style="border-radius: 50px;"></center>
 	<P  class ="container" style=" color: white; font-size: 15px;">The blue-winged parakeet is bluish grey with a long yellow-tipped tail. The black neck ring is complete in both males and females. The male has a bluish-green lower edge to the black collar and the upper mandible is red with a white tip while the female has an all black bill and has only the black collar. The female looks similar to the female of the plum-headed parakeet which however can be told apart by its broad yellow collar. Flocks move through the forest while calling out in a series of screeching keek-keek-keek calls.

    They breed in the dry season after the northeast Monsoon and the chicks fledge before the southwest Monsoon in June. They nest in holes in trees (often tall Mesua ferrea species[5]), especially old woodpecker and barbet nests. The birds begin breeding in December and eggs are laid in December and January. The usual clutch was 4 eggs which hatch after about 23 days. The female initially broods with the male bringing food and later the male takes over. The chicks fledge in about a month and leave the nest. Chicks are sometimes trapped for trade.[6] Individuals have been observed feeding on the leaves of Loranthus longiflorus.
    The closest living relative of this species is Layard's parakeet which is endemic to Sri Lanka
    This parakeet is restricted to the Western Ghats south of about 19°N (Kasa, north of Bombay) to Kerala, extending into the hills of the Palnis and Nilgiris[5] as well as the adjoining Eastern Ghats including the Biligirirangan range[9] and possibly further east in the Kolli Hills in India.</P>

 	<P  class ="container" style=" color: white; font-size: 15px;">The white-bellied blue flycatcher (   Cyornis pallidipes)
     is a small passerine bird in the flycatcher family Muscicapidae.
     It is endemic to the Western Ghats (including the Nilgiris)
     of southwest India. Males are dark blue with a lighter shade
     of blue on the brow and have a greyish white belly. Females
     have a rufous breast, a white face and olive grey above.
     This flycatcher is about 13 centimetres (5.1 in) long and has
     a longish beak. It forages in the undergrowth in the shade of
     dense forest canopy where it makes aerial forays to capture insects.
     The male is indigo blue with ultramarine blue supercilium and forehead. 
     The lores and face are dark grey. The belly is white and bordered by smoky grey wash. 
     The female is olive brown above with whitish lores.</P>

 	<P  class ="container" style=" color: white; font-size: 15px;">The white-bellied treepie (Dendrocitta leucogastra) is a bird of the crow family endemic to the forests of southern India. They overlap in distribution in some areas with the rufous treepie but are easy to tell apart both from appearance and call.The white of the head and body makes it easy to distinguish from the sympatric rufous treepie. This tends to be found in more dense forest and is less associated with human habitation than the rufous treepie.[3] The white-bellied treepie is 48 cm (19 in) long.[4] The back of the neck is white, and the throat and breast are black. The thighs are black, and the undertail coverts are chestnut. The rest of the underparts is white. The back is chestnut-brown. The wings are black and have a white patch. The rump is white. Two-thirds of the two central tail feathers are silver-grey, and the terminal third is black. The other tail feathers are black. The beak is black, and the legs are greyish-blackThe white-bellied treepie eats fruits, seeds, nectar, invertebrates, reptiles, rodents, nestlings and eggs.[4] When calling, the bird bows and droops its wings. Several birds may arrive at one tree and call repeatedly during the pre-monsoon breeding season (mainly April–May but some nests from February). The nest is a platform of twigs on a medium-sized tree.</P>

 	<P  class ="container" style=" color: white; font-size: 15px;">The black eagle (Ictinaetus malaiensis) is a bird of prey. Like all eagles, it is in the family Accipitridae, and is the only member of the genus Ictinaetus. They soar over forests in the hilly regions of tropical and subtropical South and Southeast Asia, as well as southeastern China. They hunt mammals and birds, particularly at their nests. They are easily identified by their widely splayed and long primary "fingers", the characteristic silhouette, slow flight and yellow ceres and legs that contrast with their dark feathers.
    The species name is spelt malayensis in most publications but the original spelling used by Temminck in his description uses the spelling malaiensis according to a 2011 finding of some of the original covers of the part publications leading to taxonomists applying the principle of priority and rejecting any later spelling emendations.The black eagle is a large but slender eagle, at about 75 cm (30 in) in length and 148 to 182 cm (4 ft 10 in to 6 ft 0 in) in wingspan. Despite its large appearance (it is one of the largest eagles in its range), known weights are relatively modest, at between 1,000 and 1,600 g (2.2 and 3.5 lb), about half the weight of the partially sympatric mountain hawk-eagle, the latter being of a similar total length. Adults have all-black plumage, with a yellow bill base (cere) and feet. The wings are long and pinched in at the innermost primaries giving a distinctive shape. The tail shows faint barring and upper tail covers are paler. When perched the wing tips reach till or exceed the tail tip. The wings are held in a shallow V (wings just above the horizontal plane) in flight. Seen on hot afternoons, scouring the treetops for a nest to maraud, this bird is easily spotted by its jet black colour, large size, and a characteristic slow flight, sometimes just above the canopy.
   
   <h1 class="headin">CEYLON FROGMOUTH</h1>

 	<P  class ="container" style=" color: white; font-size: 15px;">Ceylon frogmouth (Batrachostomus    moniliger) is a small frogmouth found in the Western Ghats of south India and Sri Lanka. Related to the nightjars, it is nocturnal and is found in forest habitats. The plumage coloration resembles that of dried leaves and the bird roosts quietly on branches, making it difficult to see. Each has a favourite roost that it uses regularly unless disturbed. It has a distinctive call that is usually heard at dawn and dusk. The sexes differ slightly in plumage.
    This bird reaches 23 centimetres (9.1 in) in length. Like all frogmouths, this species has a wide and hooked bill with slit-like nostrils and the large head with eyes facing forward to provide a wide field of binocular vision. Compared to others of its genus it has small wings, which are distinguished by the wing coverts ending in black spots tipped with white.[2] The male is gray-brown with fine barring and a spotted crown. Some males are browner and look more similar to females. The female is more rufous or chestnut brown. Indian female birds have very fine black speckles on the crown but Sri Lankan females may lack or may have reduced markings.[3] The bird also has short, stiff bristles in front of and surrounding the eyes. The Western Ghats population, ssp. roonwali (named after Mithan Lal Roonwal), looks very slightly different. The male has a brownish-gray wing mirror and yellowish spots on the undersides, compared to gray or white in the nominate Sri Lankan form. The female has a bright reddish-brown wing mirror and the wings are unspotted below.
