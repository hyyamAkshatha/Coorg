    Indian elephants are greyish-black animals that are subspecies of the Asian elephant. They are about 6.6 to 11.5 feet in height and weigh about 6000 to 11,000 pounds.The Indian elephant goes by the scientific name Elephas maximus indicus. They belong to the kingdom Animalia and class Mammalia. These elephants come from a family called Elephantidae and have a subspecies called E. m. indicus. They belong to the order called Proboscideans.The word elephas is the Latin influence for elephant, but it comes from the Greek word ἐλέφαντος, which could’ve been influenced by the Egyptian word for ivory or elephant. Interestingly, ivory’s etymology comes directly from Latin and Greek interpretations of the word elephant, making them interconnected forever.
    Indicus is rooted in the Ancient Greek from Ἰνδία, which means India. Essentially, the interpretation of this name simply means that the animal is a large elephant from India.
    These elephants go by the scientific name Elephas maximus indicus and have long trunks that are completely boneless. The trunks are known to be made up of about 40,000 muscles.
    Indian elephants are known to be very sociable animals and display a wide variety of emotions. They are incredibly intelligent and expressive.
    The elephant is the largest existing land mammal on the planet and originates from Africa, where it existed in a more primitive form more than 40 million years ago. The original proboscis, Moeritherium, thought to be the early-stage elephant, did not have a trunk and it is believed that these noses evolved to be primitively used as a snorkel. The elephants we see today evolved 20 million years ago from the prehistoric Gomphotherium, a pachyderm from the early Pleistocene era.

 	<P  class ="container" style=" color: white; font-size: 15px;">The Indian boar (Sus scrofa cristatus), also known as the Andamanese pig or Moupin pig,[2] is a subspecies of wild boar native to India, Nepal, Myanmar, western Thailand, and Sri Lanka
    the Indian boar differs from its European counterpart by its large mane which runs in a crest along its back from its head to lower body, larger, more sharply featured and straighter skull, its smaller, sharper ears and overall lighter build.[3] It is taller and more sparsely haired than the European form, though its back bristles are much more developed.[2] The tail is also more tufted, and the cheeks hairier.[4] Adults measure from 83.8 to 91.4 cm (33 to 36 in) in shoulder height (with one specimen in Bengal having reached 38 inches) and five feet in body length. Weight ranges from 90.7 to 136.1 kg (200 to 300 lb).[2]
    The animal has interacted with humans in India since at least the Upper Paleolithic, with the oldest depiction being a cave painting in Bhimbetaka,[5] and it occasionally appears in Vedic mythology. A story present in the Brāhmaṇas has Indra slaying an avaricious boar, who has stolen the treasure of the asuras, then giving its carcass to Vishnu, who offers it as a sacrifice to the gods. In the story in Vedic Hindu mythology, the boar is an avatar of Brahma and has raised the earth from the primeval waters during creation. In the Rāmāyaṇa, Mahabharata and the Purāṇas, another boar (Varaha) is an avatar of Vishnu that kills Hiranyaksha and saves Bhumi.

 	<P  class ="container" style=" color: white; font-size: 15px;">There are mainly two divisions in coorg , the two types are spotted deer(chittal) and the barking deer
    The chital or cheetal also known as the spotted deer, chital deer and axis deer, is a deer species native to the Indian subcontinent
    Spotted Deer is a type of wild animal that is widely distributed in Asia, especially in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan and a small group in Pakistan. Having habitats in forests and riverbanks, they can also be found in almost all countries in the tropics and subtropics.The Spotted Deer is a slightly reddish brown with white spots on its body. Only males have antlers, and their bodies are larger than females. What we need to know is, their antlers can grow into three branches! In addition, their antlers can grow back if they are broken due to fighting.a.</P>

 <h1 class="headin">THE BARKING DEER</h1>
 	<center> <img class="image-fluid" src="e929b3c20138e2d13acdc152ee7ac142.jpg"height="40%" width="40%" style="border-radius: 50px;"></center>
 	<P  class ="container" style=" color: white; font-size: 15px;">The Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) is also commonly called the "barking deer" due to the bark-like sound that it makes as an alarm when danger is present. It is also called "Kakar". Sometimes these deer will bark for an hour or more. This species is one of eleven different species of muntjacs spread across Asia. The Indian muntjacs specifically are widespread throughout Southern Asia, but are one of the least known Asian animals. Paleontological evidence proves that Indian muntjacs have been around since the late Pleistocene epoch at least 12, 000 years ago. Since then, they have played a major role in Southern Asia, being hunted for sport as well as for their meat and skin. Often these animals are hunted around the outskirts of agricultural areas as they are considered a nuisance for damaging crops and ripping bark from trees. 
    The Indian muntjac has a short but very soft, thick, dense coat, especially those living in cooler regions. Coloration of the coat changes from dark brown to yellowish and grayish brown depending on the season. The muntjacs' coat is golden tan on the dorsal side and white on the ventral side of the body, the limbs are dark brown to reddish brown, and the face is dark brown. However, the ears have very little hair which barely covers them. Male muntjacs have antlers that are very short, about 1-2 inches, usually consisting of only two or three points at the most and protrude from long body hair covered pedicels on the forehead. Females have tufts of fur and small bony knobs where the antlers are located in males. .</P>

 	<P  class ="container" style=" color: white; font-size: 15px;">Leopard
    The Indian leopard (Panthera pardus fusca) is a leopard subspecies widely distributed on the Indian subcontinent. The species Panthera pardus is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because populations have declined following habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching for the illegal trade of skins and body parts, and persecution due to conflict situations.[1] The Indian leopard is one of the big cats occurring on the Indian subcontinent, along with the Asiatic lion, Bengal tiger, snow leopard and clouded leopard. In 2014, a national census of leopards around tiger habitats was carried out in India except the northeast. 7,910 individuals were estimated in surveyed areas and a national total of 12,000–14,000 speculated.
    The leopard is elusive, solitary, and largely nocturnal. It is known for its ability in climbing, and has been observed resting on tree branches during the day, dragging its kills up trees and hanging them there, and descending from trees headfirst.[26] It is a powerful swimmer, although is not as disposed to swimming as the tiger. It is very agile, and can run at over 58 kilometres per hour (36 mph), leap over 6 m (20 ft) horizontally, and jump up to 3 m (9.8 ft) vertically.It produces a number of vocalizations, including grunts, roars, growls, meows, and purrs.</P>

 	<P  class ="container" style=" color: white; font-size: 15px;">The Indian subcontinent has only one species of Jackal i.e. Golden jackal. They are small-sized mammals as compared to their close relatives, wolves, and wild dogs. And as the saying goes “When the tiger kills, the jackal profits.” They are quite opportunistic feeders.As the name suggests, the coat is golden brown with a bit of mottled fur in between. In winter, however depending on the region, a darker coat can be seen. They are quite widespread across India. Right from the Himalayan foothills, down to the Western Ghats; the Golden Jackal has a wide distribution.The Golden Jackals are generally not pack hunters and stay in pairs. The pair hunts and scavenges together. But there have been a few records of jackals in packs, mostly grown-up pups. These are monogamous species, so they will mate for life. The pups are reared in a den. However, a jackal will have multiple dens with multiple openings for a faster escape route. The pair will defend the territory together from other jackals.
    The typical habitat of the golden jackal can be anywhere from dry deciduous forests, and semi-arid regions to agricultural lands and close to human settlement habitats.</P>


   
   <h1 class="headin">MONGOOSE</h1>

 	<center><img class="image-fluid" src="7a033f7c3430968aa09f3fc6056642a6.jpg"height="40%" width="40%" style="border-radius: 50px;"></center>
 	<P  class ="container" style=" color: white; font-size: 15px;">A mongoose is a small terrestrial carnivorous mammal belonging to the family Herpestidae. This family is currently split into two subfamilies, the Herpestinae and the Mungotinae. The Herpestinae comprises 23 living species that are native to southern Europe, Africa and Asia, whereas the Mungotinae comprises 11 species native to Africa.The Herpestidae originated about 21.8 ± 3.6 million years ago in the Early Miocene and genetically diverged into two main genetic lineages between 19.1 and 18.5 ± 3.5 million years ago.[3]
    The English word "mongoose" used to be spelled "mungoose" in the 18th and 19th centuries. The name is derived from names used in India for Herpestes species:[4][5][6][7] muṅgūs or maṅgūs in classical Hindi;[8] muṅgūs in Marathi;[9] mungisa in Telugu;[10] mungi, mungisi and munguli in Kannada.
    The form of the English name (since 1698) was altered to its "-goose" ending by folk etymology. 
    Characteristics
    Mongooses have long faces and bodies, small, rounded ears, short legs, and long, tapering tails. Most are brindled or grizzly; a few have strongly marked coats which bear a striking resemblance to mustelids. Their nonretractile claws are used primarily for digging. Mongooses, much like goats, have narrow, ovular pupils. Most species have a large anal scent gland, used for territorial marking and signaling reproductive status. 
    weight, they range from 320 g (11 oz) to 5 kg (11 lb).
    Mongooses are one of at least four known mammalian taxa with mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom. Their modified receptors prevent the snake venom α-neurotoxin from binding. These represent four separate, independent mutations. In the mongoose, this change is effected, uniquely, by glycosylation
