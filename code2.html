		 <p class="container" style="color: white; font-size: 20px ;" >Coffee in south India is a competitive commodity to the infamous tea that dominates India’s northern states. Estates are plentiful in the southern Indian states of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The plants grow beneath thick, natural shade in ecologically diverse and sensitive regions of the Western and Eastern Ghats. Coffee plantations simultaneously contribute to the biodiversity of the local ecosystem and to the socioeconomic development of these hilly, rural regions.

         Coorg grows 40 percent of India’s coffee, and the local economy relies heavily on it. The majority of the uninhabited land is cultivated coffee farms, many of them still owned by families as they were when coffee estates first emerged in the mid-19th century.

         Today, Karnataka yields 140,000 tons of coffee a year and is the largest producer of coffee in the country. As a whole, India produces 299,300 tons of coffee annually, according to a 2019-2020 census by THE COFFEE BOARD OF INDIA. India is the third-largest producer and exporter of coffee in Asia and the sixth-largest producer and fifth-largest exporter of coffee in the world. It accounts for 3.14 percent of the global coffee production. Seventy percent of India’s coffee is exported, and thirty percent is distributed and consumed domestically.

Pepper is usually harvested between March and May before the fruits turn red. The harvested fruits are dried and cured normally on bamboo mats.

In recent years the cultivation area has come down to less than 2,000 hectares.[1] Coorg orange was mainly cultivated in the districts of Kodagu, Hassan and Chikmagalur as a secondary crop in coffee plantations for more than 150 years.[2][1]

     Coorg oranges are regarded as man-made hybrids of mandarins (Citrus reticulata).[3] Greenish-yellow in colour, they have a tight skin and a sweet-sour taste, unlike Nagpur oranges which are known to have loose skin and sweet taste.[1] Coorg oranges are said to have longer shelf life compared to other varieties.[4] The hilly terrain with well-drained soil and heavy rainfall in the region of cultivation are regarded as the reasons for the unique characteristics of this variety.[5]

     Coorg orange cultivation has decreased in recent years due to diseases, emergence of Nagpur orange, among other factors.[6] The yield of each plant has come down to around 10kg which was once more than 50kg.[1] The average production of the fruit is over 45,000 tonnes

Also known as: rice paddy
Agriculture is practiced more in Kodagu, characteristically and historically, paddy fields are found on the slopy surface, with coffee and pepper agroforestry in the surrounding hills mainly near Madikeri. The most common plantation crop is coffee, especially coffee robusta variety. Kodagu is the second coffee production region in India, after the Baba Budangiri hills in Chikmagalur district. Coffee revenue has helped Kodagu to become one of the richest districts in India.
 
paddy, also called rice paddy, small, level, flooded field used to cultivate rice in southern and eastern Asia. Wet-rice cultivation is the most prevalent method of farming in the Far East, where it utilizes a small fraction of the total land yet feeds the majority of the rural population. Rice was domesticated as early as 3500 BC, and by about 2,000 years ago it was grown in almost all of the present-day cultivation areas, predominantly deltas, floodplains and coastal plains, and some terraced valley slopes.

Many paddies are flooded by rivers and rainfall during monsoon season, while others must be irrigated. The paddies have an impermeable subsoil and are bordered by earthen bunds to hold an average of 4–6 inches (10–15 centimetres) of water in the field for three-quarters of the growing season. In all countries, excluding India, paddies are worked by family labour alone and by the same methods as were used 2,000 years ago: hand cultivation with hoe and spade, or water-buffalo-, horse-, or ox-drawn plough with metal share.

The paddy transplantation and sowing activities have been completed in Virajpet taluk and the farmers are hopeful of a good yield during the Kharif season. With the region experiencing good showers, the farmers have taken up paddy cultivation on 9,837 hectares in six hoblis in Virajpet taluk, including Ponnampet. Farmers have sown the seeds of Tunga, RNR, Tanu, BR-2655, IR-64, Jaya, Uma and other varieties
Atheera variety has been preferred by the farmers for the quantity of paddy straw that it fetches.
St Annamma Church authorities have cultivated paddy on 30 acres of land in Arji village.</p>

		and, though it is most widely consumed in those regions, it is valued 
		worldwide for its flavour, nutritional value, and availability throughout
 		the year. Cavendish, or dessert, bananas are most commonly eaten fresh, 
		though they may be fried or mashed and chilled in pies or puddings. 
		They may also be used to flavour muffins, cakes, or breads. Cooking
 		varieties, or plantains, are starchy rather than sweet and are grown
 		extensively as a staple food source in tropical regions; they are cooked
		when ripe or immature. A ripe fruit contains as much as 22 percent of 
		carbohydrate and is high in dietary fibre, potassium, manganese, and
 		vitamins B6 and C.

        as ‘Burma bamboo’ was first introduced in Coorg District, Karnataka in 1913 as per records. It has since then been preferred for cultivation in homesteads by enterprising farmers mainly due to its large size, straight growth habit and thornless nature in sharp contrast to other local bamboo species like D.strictus and B.bambos. In addition to traditional uses such as for ladders and for basket weaving, this species is currently used widely as fencing poles for ginger cultivation in upland paddy fields. Burma bamboo is one of the giant bamboo species found in India, the other being Dendrocalamus giganteus. The National Mission on Bamboo Application (NMBA, Government of India) has identified 15 commercially important bamboo species based on properties and assessment of inherent characteristics matching with end uses (Anonymous, 2003). Dendrocalamus brandisii is recognized as one among most valuable multipurpose bamboo species in India. Burma bamboo being a fast growing species has potential in farm forestry, social forestry and agro forestry in humid tropics (Anonymous,2005).</p>

	and have a triangular cross-section. The pods contain a number of seeds,
 	but the entire cardamom pod can be used whole or ground. 
	The seeds are small and black, while the pods differ in color and size by species.
	<br>Varieties of Cardamom:<br>
	There are two main types of cardamom: black cardamom and green cardamom, and there is also white cardamom which is a bleached version of green cardamom. Green cardamom is the kind found most often in Nordic and Middle Eastern cuisine, while recipes in India and Asia will often specify whether green or black cardamom is used.

	Green cardamom (Elettaria cardamomom) is known as true cardamom. This is the most common variety you will see sold in the spice aisle of the supermarket. It is the top choice for sweet dishes but also works well in savory dishes. The bleached version, white cardamom, has less flavor. It is grown in tropical areas including India, Malaysia, and Costa Rica.
